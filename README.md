A curated list of awesome applications, software, tools and shiny things for Windows. :tada:

This list was created on [Jul 26, 2021](https://github.com/Lumaeris/awesome-windows/commit/6430946c400e31c034a7620578143165c6e1cb92) and based on the wonderful work of https://github.com/Awesome-Windows/Awesome. However, the original list had obsolete links and items were mostly not in alphabetical order, so I made a fork to fix this and add new products faster.

If you notice obsolete or dead links, please be kind enough to report them by [creating an issue](https://github.com/Lumaeris/awesome-windows/issues/new) or by [making a pull request](https://github.com/Lumaeris/awesome-windows/edit/main/README.md). Thanks!

_Items marked with ![Open-Source Software][OSS Icon] are open-source software. Items marked with ![Freeware][Freeware Icon] are free (as in free beer)._
